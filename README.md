# Image Replace

Are you sick of looking at that pretentious unicorn in the WordPress Theme Unit Testing data.  I know I sure am, so i did something about it! And now for the low low price of absolutely EFFING free you can save yourself too!  By installing this plugin all images served via the_post_thumbnail will now be images from Futurama, Star Trek, and / or My Little Pony!

While this started as a complete joke, I found it actually helpful when locally working on WordPress sites with large media libraries as I didn't want to download 4 billion images.  This plug greatly sped up local load times as you have actual images to load.

### Note: The Royal We are only supporting JPEGs right now

### Note: imgs/temp must be writable

## I still got a lot of work to do, like this stuff:
- ~~img cropping and temp saving~~
- ~~Transient filter return~~
- addition show / topics / movie images
- add support for PNGs and GIFs
- ~~Options page for ^ that stuff ( probably a dashboard widget )~~
